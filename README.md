# WeakAuras

This is the source code for some of the
[WeakAuras](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/) I maintain and publish on
[wago](https://wago.io/p/Inkounter).  For those familiar with how WeakAuras
works, the code is obviously already "open source"; I need source control (and
`vim`) to stay sane.
